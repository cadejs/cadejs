ðŸš€ Full-Stack Data Scientist | ML Researcher | Data Engineer

I'm a full-stack data scientist with a background in ML research and data engineering, known for turning complex problems into high-impact, production-ready systems. I specialize in owning the full lifecycleâ€”from early exploratory analysis and prototyping to deploying scalable, maintainable ML pipelines in production environments.

My work spans multiple domains:

    Geospatial & Remote Sensing (NASA): Terrain analysis, flood risk modeling, and spatial feature engineering

    Energy Forecasting (DOE): Probabilistic time-series modeling and demand simulation

    Healthcare & Location Intelligence: Site selection models for urgent care centers, using spatial and demographic features

    Startup Ops & Growth (Booster): Simulation tools, pricing optimization, and causal modeling for business decisions

Iâ€™m deeply fluent in both modeling and infrastructure:

    Production ML (regression, classification, clustering, forecasting, Bayesian methods)

    End-to-end pipelines with ETL, Reverse ETL, and model observability

    Large-scale computing with Apache Spark and Databricks

    Tools: Python, SQL, Spark, dbt, Airflow, Databricks, PyTorch, scikit-learn, QGIS, AWS

Iâ€™m particularly excited by opportunities at the intersection of AI, infrastructure, and decision-makingâ€”where tight feedback loops between models, data systems, and human insight can unlock massive value.
ðŸ§  I thrive in environments where:

    Research meets execution

    Engineers and scientists collaborate

    There's room to own, ship, and scale ideas
