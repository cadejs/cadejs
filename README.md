## ðŸš€ Full-Stack Data Scientist | ML Researcher | Data Engineer  

I'm a **full-stack data scientist** with a background in **ML research** and **data engineering**, known for turning complex problems into high-impact, production-ready systems. I specialize in owning the full lifecycleâ€”from early exploratory analysis and prototyping to **deploying scalable, maintainable ML pipelines** in production environments.

My work spans multiple domains:  
- **Geospatial & Remote Sensing** (NASA): Terrain analysis, flood risk modeling, and spatial feature engineering  
- **Energy Forecasting** (DOE): Probabilistic time-series modeling and demand simulation  
- **Healthcare & Location Intelligence **(CSL): Site selection models for medical centers, using spatial and demographic features  
- **Startup Ops & Growth** (Booster): Simulation tools, pricing optimization, and causal modeling for business decisions  

Iâ€™m deeply fluent in both **modeling** and **infrastructure**:  
- Production ML (regression, classification, clustering, forecasting, Bayesian methods)  
- End-to-end pipelines with ETL, Reverse ETL, and model observability  
- Large-scale computing with **Apache Spark** and **Databricks**  
- Tools: Python, SQL, Spark, dbt, Airflow, Databricks, PyTorch, scikit-learn, QGIS, AWS  

Iâ€™m particularly excited by opportunities at the intersection of **AI, geospatial, infrastructure, and decision-making**â€”where tight feedback loops between models, data systems, and human insight can unlock massive value.

## ðŸ§  I thrive in environments where:
- Research meets execution
- Buisiness needs are at the center of the project 
- Engineers and scientists collaborate  
- There's room to **own, ship, and scale** ideas
